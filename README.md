# solar regression application : prostate cancer data
> solar regression applications to small dataset with complicated dependence structures

## About this file
> - This file includes codes for solar application on prostate cancer regression. 
> - Compared with lasso and elastic net, solar remain sparse and stable on variable selection.
> - For details please read the paper *Accuracy and stability of solar variable selection comparison under complicated dependence structures* by Ning Xu, which can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15614
